It was run right after another test wheel (TW09May2016), which also focussed on XCAMS beam transport. The TW3060 results show that proper performance has not returned yet. For example, 2x ST OxIs come out 1% too low and were for that reason not used to calibrate the here reported results with. Considering other artefacts, it seems useless to take analysis of these data any further. However, the results of the IAEA-C1 blanks from the water- and carbonate lines are not compromised by the machine problems and thus may contain valuable information about the processing blank on these lines. A full AMS-technical analysis of all results obtained with this wheel can be found in I:\XCAMS\3_measurements\C-14 AMS\TW data analysis\TW3050-3099\TW3060. The conclusions drawn from it are:1	Graphite weights > 1 mg generated on average lower 12C beam current than those < 1 mg C. This points to a problem with too low Fe:C ratio or beam emittance.2	12C transmission and 13C/12C ratio show dependency on graphite weight: Lower weights are associated with lower ratios.3	The run-to-run variability of these parameters is also weight dependent: Lower weights are associated with faster trending-down ratios.4	The beam current has been trending upward while 12C transmission and 13/12 ratio trended downward.5	Whatever the causal link between transmission and 13/12 ratio, the measurement data show correlation. The flask OxI and some other cathodes deviate from that correlation pattern.6	Among the cathodes, the transmission values vary by 0.6% absolute. This is not 'super-tight', but by itself still acceptable.7	After correction for del13C_irms, the 13C/12C ratios vary among the cathodes by 10 permil.

On the basis of one size-matching Kauri Renton Rd blank (TP71784, TW3100), MCC and DCC for these two unknowns were calculated. Changing to these MCC values makes no significant difference, but changing to these DCC values has a significant effect. This is all explained qualitatively by the fact that the unknowns are near-modern, for which we expect the blank correction to be dominated by the dead carbon component.

Our best guess (but only a guess) is room air contamination on the graphite for hte flask 1 Ox in this wheel.  Also not sure about the EA Ox in this wheel, likely a separate issue.  System error is 0.26% using all 5 flask Oxs, which is the same as the wheel to wheel error we currently assign to carbonates.
