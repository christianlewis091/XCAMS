The measurement shows that this different way of proceeding increased the 14C count rate by ca. a factor x4. This is a much higher count rate than we would expect from variability in the machine blank values we are accustomed to. Also, there were two other blanks (TP60325,60316) with a lower 14C count rate (0.41 14C cnt/s) than the new machine blank cathode (TP60326, 0.48 14C cnt/s).

It was run right after another test wheel (TW09May2016), which also focussed on XCAMS beam transport. The TW3060 results show that proper performance has not returned yet. For example, 2x ST OxIs come out 1% too low and were for that reason not used to calibrate the here reported results with. Considering other artefacts, it seems useless to take analysis of these data any further. However, the results of the IAEA-C1 blanks from the water- and carbonate lines are not compromised by the machine problems and thus may contain valuable information about the processing blank on these lines. A full AMS-technical analysis of all results obtained with this wheel can be found in I:\XCAMS\3_measurements\C-14 AMS\TW data analysis\TW3050-3099\TW3060.
